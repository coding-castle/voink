ðŸ“º A Twitch VOD Yoinker

This app lets you download Twitch VODs directly in the browser! No need to install anything, just search for the vod and download it. To make this possible the app utilizes bleeding edge browser APIs the allow us to stream data directly into a download. So no, this will not fill up your RAM but it will go straight to the disk. But since this is quite new and not available in all browsers please use the controls provided by the app to e.g. cancel the download and don't close the site while downloading.

Enjoy!
